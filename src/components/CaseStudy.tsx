            How a Local HVAC Company Increased Bookings by 25 Per Month After a CRM Rebuild

                  This local HVAC company was growing, but their backend tools were falling behind. With five field technicians and two office staff, they were doing their best to manage demand. But their outdated CRM created more problems than solutions.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/70 mb-6">
                  The business was ready for the next stage, but their system was holding them back. They didn't need more tools. They needed one system that supported the entire team and made their day-to-day smoother.

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The office staff spent hours manually confirming bookings and tracking jobs through spreadsheets and group chats. It was messy and time-consuming.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Follow-ups were often missed. Annual maintenance clients were being forgotten. And there was no clear pipeline to track leads, jobs, or customer activity.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Technicians in the field had no access to real-time job information. They often relied on messages or printed notes, which led to delays and inconsistent service.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg">
                    The team was working hard, but the lack of structure made everything feel reactive.

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I led a complete rebuild of their CRM by first migrating all client, job, and quote data. Once their records were cleaned and organized, I created a streamlined system tailored to how their team actually operated.

                        They now have a clean visual pipeline that shows where every job stands. Bookings and assignments are handled in just a few clicks. All client records, notes, and status updates are in one centralized space.

                      <p className="text-white/80">
                        I built a mobile-friendly interface where they can view job details, update progress, upload photos, and add notes right from their phones. Everyone stays aligned in real time.

                        Automated confirmations, reminders, and follow-ups are now sent without anyone on the team lifting a finger. I also added recurring service alerts for annual maintenance clients to increase repeat business and retention.
